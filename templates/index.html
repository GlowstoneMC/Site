                    If you're unable to join our channel, <strong><a href="irc://irc.esper.net/Ultros">#Ultros on EsperNet</a></strong>,
                    or unable to talk there, then please send a private message to g (g, gShop2002, gDroid2002) or Kasen (Kasen, rakiru),
                    presuming we're around at the time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes we have to do this to moderate unsavory users, people with botnets, and so on. Please don't take it personally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, we've been making some core API changes recently. If you update your bot and your plugins
                    stop working, you should also do a plugin update to ensure everything is up to date. See below for information on both of
                    these operations.

                        Updating the bot (both operations require that git is installed)

                            <li>With git directly: <code>$ git pull</code></li>

                Mumble? Sure, why not! Ultros ships with both of these protocols as standard, and

            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p> There are a lot of bots out there - so many that it would be impossible to list
                them all off in one place. While a lot of hard work does go into these bots, we
                feel that they often have limitations that make working with them troublesome.
                For example, most bots will only be able to connect to one chat network, will
                only be able to connect once per instance, and will be difficult to customize
                due to the choice of language.
            </p>
            <p> Ultros solves these problems. By leveraging the power of the incredibly popular
                <a href="http://python.org">Python language</a>, we are able to produce a bot that
                challenges all of the above problems. We hope it does this sufficiently for most
                people's needs.
