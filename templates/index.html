                hope you will too.

                which allows developers to easily create their own protocol objects. These objects
                allow Ultros to work over a wide range of platforms. Want an IRC bot? No problem!
                Mumble? Sure, why not! Ultros ships with both of these protocols as standard, and
                more are being developed over time.

            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p> There are a lot of bots out there - so many that it would be impossible to list
                them all off in one place. While a lot of hard work does go into these bots, we
                feel that they often have limitations that make working with them troublesome.
                For example, most bots will only be able to connect to one chat network, will
                only be able to connect once per instance, and will be difficult to customize
                due to the choice of language.
            </p>
            <p> Ultros solves these problems. By leveraging the power of the incredibly popular
                <a href="http://python.org">Python language</a>, we are able to produce a bot that
                challenges all of the above problems. We hope it does this sufficiently for most
                people's needs.
