## Metrics!

        ## Introduction to metrics
        <div class="grid-16 grid">
            <h1>Metrics</h1>

            <p>
                We collect various anonymous metrics from running Ultros bots automatically, in the interests of curiosity and research, and for keeping track of popularity,
                interest and receptiveness to updates.
            </p>
            <p>
                Metrics are collected anonymously and are easy to opt-out of. Each instance of Ultros gets a UUID, which is not public, and is the only way to identify a
                bot on the system. No IP addresses are collected, however they may appear in the server logs.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're running a bot and would like to disable metrics, simply open <strong>config/settings.yml</strong> and change <code>metrics: on</code> to
                <code>metrics: off</code>. Please don't remove <strong>data/metrics.yml</strong> - we need the UUID within to delete our stored metrics for your bot.
                Please also note that UUIDs with disabled metrics are still kept in the database (and counted below).
            </p>
            <p>
                If you really must do so, you can entirely remove your metrics by opening <strong>config/settings.yml</strong> and settings <code>metrics</code> to
                <code>destroy</code>. <strong>This will entirely remove your UUID from the database and delete it from your bot's storage!</strong>
                Please note that if you do this, you'll be assigned a new UUID should you ever decide to re-enable metrics.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> If you disable metrics before your bot has been assigned a UUID, the bot will never contact the server and you won't need to
                destroy your metrics as detailed above.
            </p>
        </div>

        ## General metrics
        <div class="grid-16 grid">
            <h2>

            </h2>

            <p>
                <small>
                    These are general metrics, which show some simple counts. Metrics are collected every ten minutes, which allows us to discern which bots are online.
                    If a bot hasn't been seen for two weeks, then it's not considered "active" until it's seen again.
